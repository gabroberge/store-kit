/**
 * Locks `keys` until the transaction ends: MySQL's counterpart of PostgreSQL's `advisoryLock()`
 * (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`), on rows of the kit's `<schema>_locks` table, which every store's schema has (so two
 * stores, or two schemas of one, never share a lock). `GET_LOCK()` can't serve inside a transaction: it's held by the
 * session, past the transaction's end. A key's row is its SHA-256 (`lockRowId()`), so any key fits and two keys never
 * share one; the rows are taken in the order of those ids, each once, so two transactions locking overlapping sets
 * can't deadlock. Exclusive locks take two statements for all the keys: the rows ensured (`INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY
 * UPDATE`, which already locks an existing row exclusively), then locked (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`). `shared` locks
 * (`FOR SHARE`) exclude exclusive ones, not each other; a key's first lock creates its row, and holds it exclusively
 * even when asked for a shared one.
 *
 * ```ts
 * await retryOnDeadlock(this.executor, async (tx) => {
 *   await lockKeys(tx, this.schema, messages.map((message) => `key:${message.key}`));
 *   // insert the messages: a key's writers take turns until each commits
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A lock whose row exists never deadlocks the transactions waiting for it. One whose row the locking transaction
 * creates can: if that transaction rolls back while two or more others wait for the new row, MySQL makes them deadlock
 * (one or more fail with 1213), at READ COMMITTED as well as REPEATABLE READ; it's the duplicate-key wait on a rolled
 * back insert, not a gap lock. So a store creates the rows of its fixed keys ahead of time, in a transaction of its own
 * (`ensureLockRows()`), and maps keys without bound (a message's key) onto a fixed set of such rows (the outbox's
 * 16,384 buckets): a key's first lock in the application's transaction then never creates a row.
